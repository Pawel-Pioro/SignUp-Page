# SignUp-Page

A modern sign-up page made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript which asks the user for their first name, last name and their gmail.
The JS runs a check to see if the user filled all the fields and click the checkbox. If the check is successful, then the info is passed into a google form which can be viewed in a database. This website was created as a test and the info is not used in anyway.
